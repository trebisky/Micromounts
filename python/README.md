This is a database to keep track of my micromount mineral collection.

This directory holds the current active python version.
It is not yet finished.

-- labels is a command line program to generate label sheets

This began in July 2024 when ruby gems got screwed up and I gave up
trying to fix it.  The gems had been a periodic source of hassle,
and finally enough was enough.

The database is in sqlite3, and doesn't care whether it is accessed
via ruby or python.
The labels themselves are done using postscript.
