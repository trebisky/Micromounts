I began work on this in March of 2018, then dropped it until
February of 2019.

See /home/tom/bin for the scripts micros and micros2
See /u1/rails/micromounts (which should still work).

The database itself is minerals.sqlite3 (297984 bytes).
This is a verbatim copy of /u1/rails/micromounts/db/development.sqlite3

Ruby GTK, and in particular gtk3 seems to be almost an orphaned project.
Documentation is almost non-existant, but we get by.
However, if this falls off the wagon in the future, we might have
to port this whole project to Python-GTK.
This would be an option if all hell breaks loose.

Also, I have in no way investigated the issues involved with
starting from scratch with the database.  I just copied the
rails database and began working with it.  This has worked out
fine for me, but some other person would want to set up the
database with an appropriate schema and start creating records,
maybe even import records from a CSV file.  Since this is not
any kind of need of mine, I may never get around to tackling
this, but it would be a matter of working with sqlite3 via the
command line tool they provide.
