I began work on this in March of 2018, then dropped it until
February of 2019.

See /home/tom/bin for the scripts micros and micros2
See /u1/rails/micromounts (which should still work).

The database itself is minerals.sqlite3 (297984 bytes).
This is a verbatim copy of /u1/rails/micromounts/db/development.sqlite3
