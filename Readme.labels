To make labels:

cd python
vi Makefile
make
# lpr label_sheet.ps
make print

You will see that the Makefile runs the command line
"labels" program, which accepts a list of specimens for
which labels are desired.  It fills the sheet beginning
at the last label specified up to the end of the database.

label_sheet.ps is the output.
